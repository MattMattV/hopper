# Internationalization

This application supports multiple languages and locales.

# Language Selection

The language used for any given request is selected using the following process as implemented in `src/http/middleware_i18n.rs`.

1. The `lang` cookie is read and it's value parsed as a comma separated list of language codes. The first one that matches a supported language is selected.
2. The `Accept-Language` HTTP header is read and it's value parsed as a comma separated list of language codes. The first one that matches a supported language is selected.
3. The default languge `en-US` is used.

# Files

Language content is stored in two places: template files and translation files.

## Templates

HTML templates are rendered using the minijinja2 library. Template file names include three parts:

1. The template key (`index`, `spec`, and `alert`)
2. The locale, lowercased (`en-us`)
3. A modifier, used for partial rendering via htmx (empty, `bare`, `partial`)

Additionally, there are common and shared templates used by localized templates including `base` and `footer`.

For example, the home page has three variants: `index.en-us.html` for the standard (full) render, `index.en-us.partial.html` for the HTMX partial render, and `index.en-us.bare.html` for the HTMX boosted (bare) render. Additionally, the `base.en-us.html` and `footer.en-us.html` templates are included as needed by the home page templates.

## Strings

This project uses [https://projectfluent.org/](https://projectfluent.org/) for translated strings that are used in the application. The primary use case is for translating errors.

Application errors are in the format of `error-code english-message: detailes`. When rendering errors, the `error-code` prefix is extracted from the message and used as the string key in translations.

### Example Error

When an AT-URI cannot be processed, the following error is used: `error-web-invalid-aturi Invalid AT-URI`

The error is expanded into two parts:

* `error-web-invalid-aturi` is the error code
* `Invalid AT-URI` is a default, non-translated error message

The error code is referenced in translations. If a translated string is found, then the translated string is displayed to the user. If no translation is found, the original non-translated error message is provided to the user.

# Translation Checklist

* [ ] Is the language represented as a valid [Unicode Language Identifier](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35.html#Unicode_language_identifier)?
* [ ] Have all of the files matching templates/\*.en-us.\* been copied for the new language?
* [ ] Have all of the files matching i18n/en-us/\* been copied for the new language?
* [ ] Has the language code been added to the `src/bin/hopper.rs` `supported_languages` list?
